- Flags **fully merged** vs. **pointer merged** branches
- Filter by **author** or **branch name**
- Generates a **responsive HTML report** with dark theme
- Supports local and remote branches
- Optional **caching** for fast repeated runs

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔧 Parameters

```
Get-StaleGitBranches.ps1 [-OlderThanDays <int>] [-IncludeRemote] [-CleanCache]
                         [-Limit <int>] [-OutputPath <string>] [-Location <string>]
```

| Parameter        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-OlderThanDays` | Only include branches whose latest commit is older than this many days.    |
| `-IncludeRemote` | Include remote branches (default: false).                                  |
| `-CleanCache`    | Clears the local cache before running.                                     |
| `-Limit`         | Only process up to this many branches (for faster testing).                |
| `-OutputPath`    | Path to save the HTML report. If not specified, saves to Documents folder. |
| `-Location`      | Path to the Git repo. Optional if script is run from within the repo.      |

### 📄 Example

```powershell
.\Get-StaleGitBranches.ps1 -IncludeRemote -OlderThanDays 30 -CleanCache
```

## 📁 Output

The report is saved as an HTML file (e.g. `stale-branches.html`) and includes:

- Scrollable, filterable table of stale branches
- Author summary with counts
- GitHub links to each branch
- Merge status and open PR indicators

## 🔍 Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core
- Git CLI installed and available in PATH

## 🧹 Why?

Over time, Git branches accumulate — many of them forgotten after being merged or abandoned. This tool helps you **audit**, **track**, and **clean** them up safely.
